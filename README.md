# fillit @ 42
Can you feel it?

After finishing libft, fillit is the second mandatory project before
get_next_line, and after that, you branch out. The purpose is to make the
smallest possible "square" (which can contain holes) with a given list of
tetriminos, but the disposition must be as such that it returns the first
possible solution.

## Compiling
Run `make`, an executable called `fillit` should compile directly. Please submit
an issue if you run into any.

## Usage
`./fillit [file]`

Example:
```
~ ./fillit samples/test_8

.AABB..
AACCB..
.CC.BDD
.EE.DD.
EEFFGG.
.FFGGHH
....HH.
```

## A little note for 42 students
Doing `fillit` as well? Don't copy code! Take a piece of paper and try figuring
it out. If you don't understand, I'll explain it to you in person or by
e-mail/Slack/whatever! Find me on the intranet, my login is the same as on
GitHub :)! 

Also, yes, I am aware this isn't the fastest there is, but it will validate the
project just fine, so I'm not going to bother for now. I'll try some other time.

Good luck, and thanks for all the fish!
