# fillit @ 42
Can you feel it?

After finishing libft, fillit is the second mandatory project before get_next_line, and after that, you branch out. As an extra challenge, I store all the values in chars to really maximize memory efficiency.

## Compiling
**Currently, the project does not compile. It is in development!**

Run `make`, an executable called `fillit` should compile directly. Please submit an issue if you run into any.

## Usage
`./fillit [file]`

Example:
```
...
```

## A little note for 42 students
Doing `fillit` as well? Don't copy code! Take a piece of paper and try figuring it out. This code uses [bitwise operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operations_in_C) to try and maximimize memory efficiency. If you don't understand, I'll explain it to you in person or by e-mail/Slack/whatever! Find me on the intranet, my login is the same as on GitHub :)! 

Good luck, and thanks for all the fish!
